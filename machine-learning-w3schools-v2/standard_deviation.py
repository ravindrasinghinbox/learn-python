Standard deviation is a number that describes how spread out the values are.
A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the mean (average) value.
A high standard deviation means that the values are spread out over a wider range.

(-45.4)2 = 2061.16

The variance is the average number of these squared differences:
(2061.16+1128.96+3672.36+2440.36+338.56+0.16+384.16) / 7 = 1432.2

the formula to find the standard deviation is the square root of the variance:
